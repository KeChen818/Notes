The **market risk in a lending portfolio is generally lower** because of the **nature of the lending business model**. Hereâ€™s a breakdown using business logic:

---

### ðŸ”¹ 1. **Fixed Cash Flows, Not Market-Valued Assets**

- Lending portfolios (e.g., corporate loans, mortgages) generate **contractual interest and principal payments**.
    
- Their returns are **not tied to market prices**, unlike trading or investment portfolios.
    
- Example: A bank loan doesn't lose value just because equity markets fall â€” unless there's borrower distress.
    

---

### ðŸ”¹ 2. **Held-to-Maturity Intent**

- Loans are often booked with the **intent to hold to maturity**, avoiding frequent mark-to-market valuation.
    
- This accounting treatment **buffers short-term market price swings**, unlike AFS (available-for-sale) or trading book assets.
    

---

### ðŸ”¹ 3. **Limited Exposure to Rate and FX Movements**

- While some loans may have **interest rate risk** (e.g., fixed-rate loans in a rising-rate environment), banks often hedge that or match with liabilities.
    
- **FX risk** is also limited if lending is done in the borrowerâ€™s functional currency.
    

---

### ðŸ”¹ 4. **Credit Risk Dominates**

- The **primary risk in lending** is that the borrower defaults â€” a credit event.
    
- Market risk (e.g., stock prices, bond prices, commodity prices) matters **only indirectly**, when it affects a borrower's ability to repay.
    

---

### ðŸ”¹ 5. **Low Sensitivity to Market Volatility**

- Lending returns are **predictable**, so P&L doesnâ€™t swing daily with market moves.
    
- Contrast that with trading desks or asset managers whose P&L is directly exposed to equity, FX, or rates volatility.
